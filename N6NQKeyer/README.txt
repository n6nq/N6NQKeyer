==========================================
The N6NQKeyer is the beginnings of a project to implement a amatuer radio
morse code keyer. When finished, it while provide an output keying connection
for driving the keying input of a typical transceiver. It will provide inputs 
for a standard paddle and a PS/2 keyboard. The future version may allow for allow
a straight, at the moment I do not own a straight key, so I will focus on what 
I have so that testing as I go may be accomplished.

Besides converting keyboard and paddle input to keying output, I intend to implement
programable keyboard macros and other convienence as they occur to me. You might ask
why don't I just buy one? I like to write code and tinker.

8/11/2016 First checkin. Implements the basic sending logic and circular buffer.
